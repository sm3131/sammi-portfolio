# Description
The goal of this project was to design a responsive and creative professional portfolio in React to showcase my prior and future coding projects. This professional portfolio is meant to provide potential employers with information about myself and the coding work I have conducted. Previously I created a professional portfolio using HTML and CSS, so this iteration was meant to vastly improve upon the layout, design, and functionality of my portfolio. The purpose of creating this portfolio webpage was to have a space where I can easily organize, update, and present projects I have created. 

This portfolio webpage is mobile friendly, accessible, and contains navigation links, project images/links, and contact information. It was designed to be user-friendly and allow for effortless navigation and discovery.
